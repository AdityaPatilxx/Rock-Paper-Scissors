# Project Journal

This project was a valuable exercise, helping me not only to familiarize myself with JavaScript syntax but, more importantly, to strengthen my problem-solving skills. I approached each problem systematically, following a structured process:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** I focused on fully grasping the problem before jumping to solutions.

2. **Planning with a Mind Map:** I found that breaking down the problem into smaller parts and creating a mind map was particularly effective. This approach gave me a clear overview and allowed me to track progress by ticking off solved issues. It also let me adapt my plan easily, adding new tasks as I uncovered more about what was needed.

3. **Incremental Commits:** Using this structured approach helped me remember to commit regularly after solving each sub-problem. This method made version control smoother, in contrast to previous projects where I committed only at the end.

Overall, this project significantly improved both my technical and organizational skills, creating a foundation for more effective problem-solving in future work.
